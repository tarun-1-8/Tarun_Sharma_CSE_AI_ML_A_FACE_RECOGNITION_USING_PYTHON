## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project explains a face recognition system developed using Python. It highlights objectives, methodology, real-time implementation, and applications in security, attendance, and smart devices. The project uses libraries like OpenCV and dlib to ensure accurate facial detection. Challenges like lighting and angles are also addressed, enhancing overall system reliability.

## Technologies used
### Python â€“ Core language used for all scripts.
### face_recognition

### For detecting and recognizing faces in images and real-time video.

### OpenCV (opencv-python)

### Used for video capture from the webcam, image processing, and GUI display (like bounding boxes).

### tkinter

### For building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the main application (main_app.py).

### pickle

### To save and load serialized data (face encodings and names).

### urllib.request

### To download images from the internet (in create_dataset.py).

### os and datetime (Standard Python Libraries)

### File and folder operations, getting current date/time.

### subprocess

### To call Python scripts from within the GUI app.
